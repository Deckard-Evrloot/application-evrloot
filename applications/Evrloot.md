## üîé Project Overview

# Introduction
Evrloot is a browser-based dark fantasy RPG built on Polkadot‚Äôs Moonbeam chain. Since its launch, Evrloot has:

- Recorded **~300K on-chain transactions** during soft launch and over **1.5M total transactions** to date.
- Reached roughly **8,000 monthly active users** at peak.
- Grown a **fiercely loyal community**, recognized by ecosystem leaders.
- Generated **~$2,000 marketplace fees** in a short test phase, validating the economy.

### Evrloot is the Polkadot-native game
Evrloot is the flagship blockchain game built natively on the Polkadot ecosystem, representing the most successful gaming application on the network to date. As the **Polkadot Native Game**, Evrloot has proven its market fit with thousands of active players, dominating transaction charts on Moonbeam and Polkadot throughout multiple successful seasons. Just the share of how often Evrloot was mentioned in the Kusamarian shows the pace at which Evrloot was developing. 
Evrloot was built from the ground up specifically for the Polkadot ecosystem, starting with RMRK NFTs on Kusama in 2021. We migrated to Moonbeam for smart contract functionality while maintaining deep integration with Polkadot's cross-chain capabilities. We were among the first to successfully implement RMRK 2.0 standards with our Book of Lore NFT collection, establishing ourselves as pioneers in Polkadot's NFT and gaming space.

### The strategic Pause of Evrloot
After four years of dedicated development and community building, without an OpenGov ask, Evrloot has reached a critical juncture. Despite our considerable success, the market conditions for Web3 games have drastically worsened in 2025, creating a challenging environment for funding and sustainability. Many Web3 gaming projects across the industry are struggling or shutting down due to widespread funding shortages. 
Unfortunately, we have been unable to secure the necessary funding to continue, which has led us to freeze Evrloot in its current state and reduce all operational costs, including salaries, to zero, without disbanding the company. 

### The Ask: Help with operational running cost
While this pause was a difficult but necessary step, we cannot sustain the game under these conditions in the long term and urgently need your help to preserve the community and maintain the infrastructure. We believe that, unlike many other teams, our exceptionally strong and loyal community positions Evrloot uniquely for success. This strategic pause is designed to preserve that community and strengthen our foundation, helping us secure the necessary funding to relaunch and continue growing the project within the Polkadot ecosystem.
